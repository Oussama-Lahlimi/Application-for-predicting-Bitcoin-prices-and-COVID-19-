Application for predicting Bitcoin prices and COVID-19 propagation based on an ARMA time-series analysis model


In an ever-changing world, where informed decisions and strategic 
strategic planning have become imperative, the analysis of temporal data is of paramount 
of paramount importance. Time series, which record data in temporal order, are omnipresent in our

At the heart of this analytical approach are ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average) models. 
Average) models are of undeniable importance. These models, derived from 
combine statistical rigor with predictive power, enabling us to decipher 
to decipher and anticipate trends, detect recurring patterns and understand 
and understand complex phenomena.
This report is devoted to the exploration and application of ARMA models in two 
financial markets and healthcare. Beyond their specific application, 
our aim is to illustrate how these models offer solutions to concrete 
problems.
We'll start by taking a look at the subtle but fundamental difference, 
between “prediction” and “forecasting”, concepts that underpin the very philosophy 

of time series analysis. We will then explore time series in depth 
as rich sources of information on trends, seasons and fluctuations. 
seasons and fluctuations.
We will then delve into the equations of the ARMA model, key elements of this 
analysis. By understanding these equations, we'll be better equipped to tackle concrete 
applications.
Finally, we'll focus on the specific applications of ARMA models in 
financial markets and healthcare. In each of these areas, we'll
discover how ARMA models can contribute to more informed decision-making 
more efficient management of resources and anticipation of future 
future developments.
Through this exploration, we will show that time series analysis and the application of 
application of ARMA models are at the heart of the transformation of raw data 
into actionable information, contributing to more informed decisions and a better 
future.
